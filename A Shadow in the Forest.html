There are skeletons on the floor and deep scratches on the mossy brick walls. A hidden door opens on the wall, and a huge, black dog walks out of it. It stares you down with its deep, ominous eyes as dark as the thing that brought you here. It jumps on top of you and sinks its long, sharp teeth into your neck. A sharp pain shoots through your body. Your vision fades into a fuzzy darkness, the current world fades away, and the people you loved race through your mind.

Pain shoots through your head like a dull bullet, and the world flashes black. You hear the black beast pummeling towards you. With warm, slick blood pouring down your face, you flip around and hear its massive paws rebound off the ground one last time before it comes down on your chest with the force of a freight train. You feel a crunch deeper and more painful than anything you've ever experienced in your life. Blood is pouring into your eyes and mouth. Numbness is spreading from your toes and fingertips. Your chest is flattened, and you are suffocating. You just want it to be over. The beast tears at your flesh.

You hear the pebbles scrape underneath your feet in the eerie silence of the forest. You realize you've been backing up for nearly a minute now and assume you're safe to turn around. Doing so, you see an abrupt, rocky cliff. You didn't think there were any cliffs nearby when you drove up here to go camping. That feels so long ago. Almost as if it were a different life that you had not lived. The forest had become your past, present, and future those few hours ago when you followed the shadow. You snap back to reality, out of your head, and see that the fog has gotten thicker. You are getting tired and decide to try to make it back to camp. You turn back towards the forest and realize you have no idea where you are. Just then, you hear a rumbling that seems to come from in front, behind, to the left, right, and underneath you. It's coming from everywhere. The ground begins to shake in a deep, slow thunder. About five feet away, you see a crack spread across the clifftop. Before you can comprehend what is happening, the earth beneath your feet drops. A drawn-out cracking noise fills the air as your stomach knots, and the pull of gravity ceases to exist.` // Level 4.2b

The wind whips in your ears as cold, damp air tears at your skin like tiny pellets. The cliffside roars beside you. Faster and faster, you plummet towards the ground. You look out at the horizon and see a raven. You watch as it glides gracefully through the wind. It dives down into the trees, which are getting closer every moment. You shut your eyes, and a thud echoes through the trees.` // Level 5.3a

You fell asleep in Algebra II class, and now everyone is staring at you like you're crazy after you jumped and slammed yourself into the desk. "What a dream," you contemplate.` // Level 5.3b

Your walk turns into a jog, which turns into a run, which turns into a sprint. The shadows are chasing you, jumping at you, and your attention is drawn to every little movement. You sprint through the forest in a panic. You feel as though the trees themselves are hunting you. You try to calm yourself down. You slow down to a fast walk and think "There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here..." You whip your head back and forth.

The sky clears, and as the sun disappears, stars fill the heavens. Almost forgetting you are lost, you decide to sleep out in the grassy fields and find your way back to camp tomorrow. You lay your head down on the soft, pillow-like dirt, and shut your eyes. When you awake, the sun is just coming up, and the sky is the color of pink lemonade. You head into the forest and quickly find your campsite. The firepit is still warm. You pack up and drive home. Over the years you try to find the fields again, with no luck. It's as if they were never there. The fields were a truly magical place, and something you will never forget.`; //Level 5.4a END

You cannot see anything, so you start feeling your way around the forest. You reach your foot out, but nothing is there. You try to pull back, but your weight is already too far over the edge. You fall for a few seconds before hitting a hard rocky surface. You can not stand, but you reach your hand out and feel a rough brick wall. You must have fallen into an old well. You realize the extent to which you have hurt yourself. Everything is throbbing with pain. You scream for help, but nobody is there to hear. You try to stand once more, but the pain is unbearable. You spend the next few days pleading for help. Your throat is as dry as a desert, and your head is pounding. Your chest begins to throb with pressure, and you become lightheaded.

After many hours, you make no progress, and it's getting cold and dark. You need to start a fire. You have no fire-building materials, and you know rubbing two sticks together doesn't quite work, but you have your phone. You get an idea. Even with a "dead" battery, the sensitive Li-Ion cell in your phone still holds a charge. If you manage to short the internal layers it might catch on fire. You search for a rock and find one that fits nicely in your palm. You pull your phone out of your pocket and turn it over. You mutter, "I sure hope this works," as you send the rough stone into the back glass. It shatters, and you brush the broken glass aside. You pull the adhesive tabs, and the battery pops out. You gather some kindling, composed of dry leaves, grass, and a few small sticks. You put it all in a pile on top of the battery and bring the rock down on top. Nothing happens, so you smash it down again. With a pop, a little puff of smoke escapes the battery. It starts hissing. The plastic label around the battery warps and shrivels. The leaves begin to smoke. You blow on it lightly, and it ignites with a woosh. The burning Lithium-Ion cell smells terrible, and the fumes burn your throat, but you have a fire. After watching it for a bit, you leave to find some sticks. You find a dead tree only twenty or so meters away and snap a branch off. You start walking back towards the fire and see a large amount of orange light coming from the area. Illuminated by the light is a huge cloud of smoke making its way through the trees. "Oh no," you remark. You start jogging and finally get a clear view. The fire has spread to the surrounding leaves. You run towards it, but quickly realize it's too late. The fire is spreading at a walking speed and only accelerating, already covering a ten-meter radius. The fire climbs the trees, its infernal tendrils reaching up and taking hold of the branches. Even from a distance, the heat is extreme, searing your face. It crawls closer and closer, faster and faster. You start backing away, and it follows you. The crawl turns to a trot, and anything within a meter catches fire spontaneously, without contact. You realize you need to start running and do so, but it might be too late. The heat scorches your back, and the whoosh gets louder and more intense behind you. "What have I done," the entire forest is illuminated like day, saturated in the harsh, orange, flickering light. The fire is fast, faster than you. You push a full sprint, but the flames soar behind you. They are catching up. The heat builds, and the crackling, roaring sound of flames vaporizing everything in their path fills the air. You cannot keep this speed up forever, and you start to stumble. Every little bump in the ground is a tripping hazard. You fall, and the flames sweep over you. The heat rips away your skin. Your sinuses are on fire. At first, it is excruciating, but after about ten seconds, there is no pain. You only see bright, burry orange light. Your throat is closed, and you are gaping for air. The world fades away.`; //Level 4.3b END

You freeze, not daring to make a sound. It begins to purr and pushes its face against you. Confused, you reach out and pet its soft, black coat. It pushes against your hand. "You're friendly?" You ask as you stroke its fur. You're tired after all of the excitement and decide to get some sleep. You walk to your tent, and it follows you. You don't believe what is happening, and as you lay down in your sleeping bag, it lays at your side, still purring with an intensity that makes the ground quiver. The warmth and sound put you to sleep in a matter of minutes. When you wake, it is not there. You will never know whether it was just a dream. "It felt too real to be a dream."

You stay silent, hoping it won't know you're there. You hear something touch the tent, but it's too dark to see. You hear claws pop through the fabric of the tent, and slice down, making a big opening. You see the outline of a bear's head poke through the hole. It reaches its neck down and sniffs your face. "NO! BACK AWAY!" It jumps back, startled by the yell, and then it stands on its back legs and roars. "GO AWAY!" It lunges down and bites into your throat. You try to scream but no sound comes out.
